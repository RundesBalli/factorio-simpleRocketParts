# factorio-simpleRocketParts
:rocket: A mod that simplifies the recipes for rocket parts, so that in the end game, your main concern is procuring a vast amount of raw materials rather than managing the factory.

## Low density structure
For [some ~~unknown~~ reason](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SimpleRocketParts/discussion/6500eac2ecd8c6a540556e48), I couldn't change the "low-density-structure", so I just left it out completely. The other materials needed are already big consumers of raw material, so it's fine like that.
